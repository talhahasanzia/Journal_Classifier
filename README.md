# JournalClassifier
Keywords based Crawler Project 

The user will post an abstract of her/his research paper and this web app will show statistics of how much each category matches from sites like ieeeexplore.ieee.org and springer.com, this will help user to classify the joournal in a more suitable way.


We will use HTML scraping to extract keywords from journals, also using html agility pack.The keywords will be collected from sites category wise, and tables will be created for each category in the database.When user submits a request these tables will be used to match these keywords.

Project is a ASP Web Forms  App, with sample front end responsive template from: http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/



Project itself has no copyrights.
